These browser extensions are provided for the purpose of enabling secure and anonymous authentication to web sites.
Since the objective is secure, anonymous authentication, our focus has been on development using i2p web sites. 

Authentication over the clearnet, exposes IP addresses and presents many risks to anonymity. In preparation for the 
Monero community adoption of Kovri, we want to begin using i2p out-of-the-gate. However, we have also created a 
Chrome browser for secure authentication over the Internet using a Monero wallet without having to use usernames 
and passwords. While this is not a pattern for securing anonymity, it does provide an approach to secure authentication
without users having to remember usernames and passwords.
