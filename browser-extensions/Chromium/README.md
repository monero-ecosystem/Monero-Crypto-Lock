This directory includes the source code for the Chromium/Google Chrome browser extension. (documentation coming soon.)

We will be providing a more involved test web application on the I2P network as well as on the Internet. The Internet site will not be an example of anonymous authentication, but rather how to provide secure authentication using a Monero wallet rather than usernames and passwords. The test web app will demonstrate approaches to session management using the Monero Authentication browser extension.
