This directory includes the source code for the Chromium/Google Chrome browser extension. (documentation coming soon.)

A browser extension test web application is available via the Internet at: http://23.92.31.84:3021/
You will need to have the monerod and monero-wallet-rpc running on the client side.

The Internet site is not an example of how to support anonymous authentication, but rather how to provide secure authentication using a Monero wallet rather than usernames and passwords.
