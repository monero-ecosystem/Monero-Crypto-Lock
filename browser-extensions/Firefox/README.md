This directory includes the source code for the Mozilla Firefox browser extension.
(documentation coming soon.)

If you are running an I2P router, you can goto: http://lrqks3cdoh5d6arrkng4njdbykveytbdzu4dl2tqizs7mnlwz7ka.b32.i2p/

To test the basic operation of the browser extension.

We will be providing a more involved test web application on the I2P network as well as on the Interne. The Internet site will not be an example of anonymous authentication, but rather how to provide secure authentication using a Monero wallet
rather than usernames and passwords. The test web app will demonstrate approaches to session management using the Monero
Authentication browser extension.
