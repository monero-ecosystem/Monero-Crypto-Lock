A nodejs web application is being hosted on the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) at:
http://lrqks3cdoh5d6arrkng4njdbykveytbdzu4dl2tqizs7mnlwz7ka.b32.i2p/

Since this is an I2P site, you will need to be on the I2P network to reach it.

This web application is a demonstration of secure, anonymous authentication on a secure,
end-to-end encrypted overlay network.

Additional information on this demonstration will be forthcoming.
