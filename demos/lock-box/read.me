The Monero Crypto-Lock Digital Lock Box is an encrypted file system container accessible through public-key cryptography 
using the Monero Crypto-Lock protocol. The digital lock box is encrypted using ecryptfs with the passphrase involving a 
specific Monero public address. The lock box can be locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) using Monero Crypto-Lock.

+ Digital lock-boxes can contain files that represent data as well as executable code.
+ Digital lock-boxes can be compressed (tar.gz) for transport over the network.

The maximum length for an ecryptfs passphrase is 64-characters. So in these simple examples, the first 64-characters of
a Monero address is used for the passphrase.

Digital lock-boxes, being encrypted file system containers, can be compressed (tar.gz) for transport. For security purposes,
it is important that a lock-box is locked (encrypted) before being compressed and ready for transport. This ensures that
the lock-box contents are unreadable during transport.

Additional documentation will follow shortly.
