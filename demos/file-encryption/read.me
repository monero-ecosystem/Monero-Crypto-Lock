This example illustrates how Monero Crypto-Lock can be used with gpg to encrypt and decrypt files.

The encryption example script illustrates how to use Monero Crypto-Lock to authenticate:
- a challenge string is provided with the expectation that it will be digitally signed by a specified Monero address.

Once authenticated a file (passed in as a command-line argument) is encrypted with gpg using the Monero address as the passphrase for encryption.
